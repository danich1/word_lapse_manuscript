# Results

1. Figure 1 - Visual to show that alignment works along intra year variation (Procrustes Validation)
  1. Umap panel for an individual year to show models are separated
  2. Umap panel to show the same year after models have been aligned
  3. Umap panel to show across years (inter-year varation)
  	  1. might not have this as a figure given the aligned umap results, but we shall see 
2. Figure 2 - CUSUM validation
  1. Table of found timepoint changes using this algorithm
  2. Highlight pandemic as positive control
  3. Nearest Neighbors upset plot ^^
  4. Might look into lung cancer or other form of cancer results
4. Figure 3 - Website walkthrough for the work done here
  1. Website screenshots
  2. Basically a walkthrough of the website and how a user can operate the web resource (similar to preprint similarity search)
