## Visualization of Word2Vec Alignment

![
A. Without alignment, each word2vec model has its own coordinate space.
This plot is a UMAP visualization of 5000 randomly sampled tokens from 5 distinctly trained word2vec models on the text published in the year 2010.
Each data point represents a token, and the color represents the Word2Vec model.
B. The highlighted token 'probiotics' shows up in their respective clusters.
Each data point represents a token, and the color represents the Word2Vec model.
C. After the alignment step, the token 'probiotic' is closer in vector space.
Each data point represents a token, and the color represents the different Word2Vec models.

Before alignment, word2vec models have their generated coordinate space as seen in (Figure {@fig:word2vec_alignment}A).
As seen in the example for the token 'probiotic' where it appeared in each respective cluster. (Figure {@fig:word2vec_alignment}B).
After alignment, we can see that the 'probiotic' tokens appear to be closer in the space (Figure {@fig:word2vec_alignment}C).

## Confirmation of the Novel Distance Metric

![
A. Tokens appear to have a larger difference without a correction step.
This time series plot shows the percent difference in the average of all tokens that appear every year compared to 2010-2011.
The line in orange is without the correction metric, and the green line is with the correction metric.

Insert excellent description behind the distance metric and how it is better than a single model.

## Changepoint Detection results

Visualizing a token's neighbors is a viable way to confirm the existence of a changepoint.
Cas9 was detected to have a changepoint from 2012 to 2013, and during this time period, gene editing terms became prevalent within the neighbors (Table {@tbl:cas9_table}).
Similarly, looking at the pandemic, there was a detected shift from 2019 to 2020, which is during the time COVID-19 became prevalent (Supplementary Table {@tbl:pandemic_table}.
