## Visualization of Word2Vec Alignment

![
A. Without alignment, each word2vec model has its own coordinate space.
This is a UMAP visualization of 5000 randomly sampled tokens from 5 distinct Word2Vec models trained on the text published in the year 2010.
Each data point represents a token, and the color represents the respective Word2Vec model.
B. The highlighted token 'probiotics' shows up in their respective clusters.
Each data point represents a token, and the color represents the Word2Vec model.
C. After the alignment step, the token 'probiotic' is closer in vector space.
Each data point represents a token, and the color represents the different Word2Vec models.

Model alignment is an essential step in allowing word2vec models to be compared.
We visualized this process using the year 2010 as an example.
Before alignment, each Word2Vec model has its own unique coordinate space (Figure {@fig:word2vec_alignment}A).
This point is reinforced by the token 'probiotic', where it appears in its respective cluster (Figure {@fig:word2vec_alignment}B).
Once alignment has been performed, we can see that each model is under the same coordinate space and the 'probiotic' tokens are now closer (Figure {@fig:word2vec_alignment}C).
Despite the alignment step, these models still have an intra-year variation that should be corrected.

## Confirmation of the new distance metric accounting for inter-year and intra-year variation.

A. Tokens appear to have a greater difference if a correction step is not implemented.
This line plot shows the percent difference of the average of all tokens shared across the years about 2010-2011.
The orange line represents tokens without considering variation, while the green line shows the variation correction step.
B. Changepoints can still be detected after accounting for variation.
This line plot shows the percent difference of tokens with an expected changepoint compared to our corrected model.
The purple line represents the 'cas9' token, and the orange line represents the 'pandemic' token.
The green line is our correction model that takes every token into account.

Tokens would appear vastly different if intra-year and inter-year variations were not considered.
We compared a single Word2Vec model with our variation correction approach to examine the differences.
The percent difference sharply increases for the single model as it moves further away from 2010-2011 (Figure {@fig: novel_distance_validation} A).
Similarly, our correction method increases as it moves away from 2010-2011; however, it is upper bounded to be no greater than 0.1 (Figure {@fig: novel_distance_validation} A).
This observation suggests that using a single model could cause more false positives in downstream analyses as tokens incorrectly appear different.
Even after our correction step, tokens that are expected to have a changepoint can be detected (Figure {@fig: novel_distance_validation} B). 
Tokens such as 'pandemic' and 'cas9' still have a percent difference of over 100% (Figure {@fig: novel_distance_validation} B), which reinforces that our correction step does not remove positive controls.

## Examining detected changepoints between preprints and published papers

![
Preprints and published works share a decent number of detected changepoints.
This Venn diagram shows the number of detected changepoints between preprints (green) and published papers (orange), while yellow represents the number of changepoints shared.

Our approach detected a substantial amount of changepoints across preprints and published papers (Figure {@fig:preprint_published_changepoints}).
We found that 'cas9' was detected to have a changepoint from 2012 to 2013, which was during the same time it became a popular gene-editing tool (Supplementary Table {@tbl:cas9_table}).
Similarly, we found that 'pandemic' was detected to have a changepoint between 2019-2020.
This was the time period that COVID-19 became a prevalent entity to research (Supplementary Table {@tbl:pandemic_table}).
Our listing of all detected changepoints is available for both sources (see Data Availability section).
Upon examining the overlap between data sources, we found a select number of tokens were related to COVID-19 (Supplementary Table {@tbl:published_preprint_change_table}).
Furthermore, we found that several shared tokens are gene acronyms and terms related to experiments that involve animals or wet-lab work (Supplementary Table {@tbl:published_preprint_change_table}).

## Word-Lapse is an online resource that enables manual examination of any token 

![
A. The trajectory visualization of the token 'pandemic' through time.
It starts at the first mention of the token and progresses through each subsequent year.
The top five neighbors are displayed for each year. 
B. The usage frequency of the token 'pandemic' through time.
The x-axis shows the year, and the y-axis shows the frequency for each token.
C. A word cloud visualization for 25 neighbors from each year for the token 'pandemic'.
This visualization highlights each neighbor given a particular year and allows for the comparison between two given years.
Tokens in purple are shared within both years, while tokens in red or blue are unique to each year.

We constructed an online application that allows users to examine how tokens change through time.
Once a token is inputted, a user is introduced to a trajectory that shows how a token's neighbors are changing throughout the years (Figure {@fig:website_walkthrough}A).
Due to visualization constraints, only five neighbors are shown.
Next, the user is subjected to a frequency chart that shows how often the particular token is used for a given year (Figure {@fig:website_walkthrough}B).
If a changepoint was detected, this visualization would have an indicator, as seen in Figure {@fig:website_walkthrough}B.
The last visualization is a word cloud that shows 25 neighbors for each given year (Figure {@fig:website_walkthrough}C).
This remedies the constraint in the trajectory visualization as it allows users to compare two different years directly.
