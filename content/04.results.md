## Models can be aligned and compared within and between years

We examined how the usage of tokens in biomedical text changes over time.
Our evaluation was derived from machine learning models designed to predict the actual token given a portion of its surrounding tokens.
Each token was represented as a vector in a coordinate space constructed by these models.
However, training these models is stochastic, which results in arbitrary coordinate spaces.

![
A. Without alignment, each word2vec model has its own coordinate space.
This is a UMAP visualization of 5000 randomly sampled tokens from 5 distinct Word2Vec models trained on the text published in 2010.
Each data point represents a token, and the color represents the respective Word2Vec model.
B. The highlighted token 'probiotics' shows up in its respective clusters.
Each data point represents a token, and the color represents the Word2Vec model.
C. After the alignment step, the token 'probiotic' is closer in vector space.
Each data point represents a token, and the color represents the different Word2Vec models.
D. Token distances appear to be vastly different without alignment than with alignment.
This boxplot shows the average distance of 100 randomly sampled tokens shared in every year from 2000 to 2021.
The x-axis shows the various groups being compared (tokens against themselves via intra-year and inter-year distances and tokens against their corresponding neighbors.
The y axis shows the averaged distance for every year.

Model alignment is an essential step in allowing word2vec models to be compared [@doi:10.48550/arXiv.1605.09096; @doi:10.1038/s41597-021-01047-x].
We visualized this process using the year 2010 as an example.
Before alignment, each model has its own unique coordinate space (Figures {@fig:word2vec_alignment}A and Figure {@fig:word2vec_alignment}B).
This result highlights that models cannot be directly compared without an alignment step.
After alignment, every model has been projected onto a shared coordinate space (Figure {@fig:word2vec_alignment}C), enabling direct token comparison.
We also validated the alignment effects by comparing one hundred randomly sampled tokens against themselves and against their respective neighbors.
Token distances, without models being aligned, appear to be vastly different (Figure {@fig:word2vec_alignment}D).
However, alignment doesn't have a large effect when the tokens are compared to their respective neighbors (Figure {@fig:word2vec_alignment}D).

Our goal was to understand changes in token usage, but this analysis was performed against the backdrop of rapid changes in publishing practices.
The texts for our analysis were open access manuscripts available through PubMed Central.
The growth in the amount of available text and the uneven adoption of open access publishing during the interval studied was expected to induce changes in the underlying machine learning models, making comparisons more difficult.
We aimed to correct for this change in the underlying models by developing a statistic that, instead of using pairwise comparisons of token distances between individual models, integrated multiple models for each year by comparing tokens' intra- and inter-year variabilities.
This statistic is defined as the ratio of the average distance between two years over the sum of the average distance within each year respectively.

![
A. The number of tokens our models have trained on increases over time.
This line plot shows the number of unique tokens seen by our various machine learning models.
The x-axis depicts the year and the y-axis shows the token count.
B. Earlier years compared to 2010 have greater distances than later years.
This confidence interval plot shows the collective distances obtained by sampling 100 tokens that are present from every year using a single model approach.
The x-axis shows a given year and the y-axis shows the distance metric.
C. Later years have a lower intra-distance variability compared to the earlier years.
This confidence interval plot shows the collective distances obtained by sampling 100 tokens that are present from every year using our multi-model approach.
The x-axis shows a given year and the y-axis shows the distance metric.

We expect most tokens to undergo minor changes from year to year, while substantial changes likely suggest model drift as opposed to true linguistic change.
We measured the extent to which model variation affects token distances over time.
We filtered our token list to only contain tokens present in every year and then compared their distance to the midpoint year, 2010, using the single-model and integrated-models strategies.
We found that distances tend to stabilize as the number of tokens for models to train on substantially increases (Figure {@fig:novel_distance_validation}A and Figure {@fig:novel_distance_validation}B).
We also found that the intra-year variation for the later years tends to be small compared to the previous years (Figure {@fig:novel_distance_validation}C).
Both trends reinforce that training on smaller corpora will lead to high variation and that an integrated model strategy is needed [@doi:10.1162/tacl_a_00008].
Based on these results, we used the integrated-model strategy to calculate inter-year token distances for the remainder of this work.

## Terms exhibit detectable changes in usage

A. The number of changepoints increases over time in PMCOA.
The x-axis shows the various time periods, while the y-axis depicts the number of detected changepoints.

The x-axis shows the time period since the first appearance of the token, and the y-axis shows the change metric.
D. 'sars' has two detected changepoints within the PMCOA corpus.
The x-axis shows the time period since the first appearance of the token, and the y-axis shows the change metric.

We next sought to identify tokens that changed during the 2000-2021 interval for the text from PubMed Central's Open Access Corpus (PMCOA) and the 2015-2022 interval for our preprint corpus.
We performed change point detection using the CUSUM algorithm with distances calculated with the integrated-model approach to correct for systematic differences in the underlying corpora.
We found 41281 terms with a detected changepoint from PMCOA and 2266 terms from preprints, and the vast majority (38019 for PMCOA and 2260 for preprints) had just a single change-point.
We found that 2020-2021 had the highest number of changepoints for the PMCOA corpus, while 2018-2019 had the highest number of changepoints using preprints (Figures {@fig:preprint_published_changepoints}A and {@fig:preprint_published_changepoints}B).
An example change point was detected for 'cas9' from 2012 to 2013 (Figure {@fig:preprint_published_changepoints}C).
Before the change point, its closest neighbors were related genetic elements (e.g., 'cas'1-3).
After the change point, its closest neighbors became terms related to targeting, sgRNA, and gRNA, as well as other genome editing strategies, 'talen' and 'zfns' (Table {@tbl:cas9_neighbor_table}).
The complete set of detected change points is available for further analysis (see Data Availability and Software).

For some terms, multiple change points were detected within or between corpora.
Out of all change points, 200 were seen by both corpora, while only 25 of the 200 terms shared the same time period.
We examined the overlap of detected change points between preprints and published articles.
We found a decent number of tokens were related to the COVID-19 (Supplementary Table {@tbl:published_preprint_change_table}).
We also found several shared tokens related to experiments involving animals or wet-lab work (Supplementary Table {@tbl:published_preprint_change_table}). <!--revisit with the updated table -->
Specific terms exhibited multiple change-points in PMCOA.
For example, change points were detected for SARS from both 2002 to 2003 and 2019 to 2020 (Figure {@fig:preprint_published_changepoints} D, Tables {@tbl:sars_neighbor_table_one} and {@tbl:sars_neighbor_table_two}), consistent with the emergences of SARS-CoV [@doi:10.1046/j.1440-1843.2003.00517.x] and SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105924; @doi:10.1038/s41564-020-0695-z] as observed human pathogens.

We constructed an online application that allows users to examine how tokens change through time.
The application supports token input as text strings or as MeSH IDs, Entrez Gene IDs, and Taxonomy IDs.
Users might elect to explore the term 'pandemic', for which we detected a change point between 2019 and 2020.
Users can examine the token's nearest neighbors through time (Figure {@fig:website_walkthrough}A).
Using the token 'pandemic' as an example, users can observe that 'epidemic' remains similar through time, but taxid:114727 (the H1N1 subtype of influenza) only entered the nearest neighbors with the swine flu pandemic in 2009 and that MeSH:C000657245 (COVID-19) appears in 2020.
The application also shows a frequency chart depicting how often the particular token is used each year (Figure {@fig:website_walkthrough}B), which can be displayed as a raw count or adjusted by the total size of the corpus.
When change points are detected, they are indicated on this panel (Figure {@fig:website_walkthrough}B).
The final visualization shows the union of the nearest 25 neighbors from each year ordered by the number of years that neighbor was present (Figure {@fig:website_walkthrough}C).
This visualization has a comparison function that allows users to examine differences between years.
All functionalities are fully supported across the PMCOA and preprint corpora, and users can toggle between the two.
