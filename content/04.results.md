# Results
<div style="color:red">
One potential results panel: comparing results with abstract and full text (since you say above full text is not so often used).
</div>

1. Figure 1 - Visual to show that alignment works along intra year variation (Procrustes Validation)
  1. Umap panel for an individual year to show models are separated
  <div style="color:red">
  I would start with the simplest possible way that you can show things, and only bring in more complexity like UMAP when necessary. I'm guessing that you would be able to show this with just PCA or similar, unless I'm not thinking correctly.
  </div>
  2. Umap panel to show the same year after models have been aligned
  3. Umap panel to show across years (inter-year varation)
  	  1. might not have this as a figure given the aligned umap results, but we shall see 
2. Figure 2 - CUSUM validation
	<div style="color:red">
	I think you might want another figure here that shows how you can use the variability in distance to address the challenges of variable training set size / model uncertainty. Let's see how things shake out as you're writing.
	</div>
  1. Table of found timepoint changes using this algorithm
  2. Highlight pandemic as positive control
  3. Nearest Neighbors upset plot ^^
  4. Might look into lung cancer or other form of cancer results
4. Figure 3 - Website walkthrough for the work done here
  1. Website screenshots
  <div style="color:red">
  The figures that make up the website might be nice to show/explain individually - not as screenshots but as actual figures (remember the PLOS situation where using a screenshot was an issue we had to work through).
  </div>
  2. Basically a walkthrough of the website and how a user can operate the web resource (similar to preprint similarity search)
