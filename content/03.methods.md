## Biomedical language examined

### Pubtator Central

Pubtator Central is an open access resource that contains preannotated biomedical abstracts and full text [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkz389].
Each annotation consists of specific words and phrases tagged to represent biomedical concepts such as genes, diseases, chemicals, species and cell lines.

mention the models used to tag concepts here

We downloaded this resource on June 19, 2021 and processing over 32 million different documents.
We preprocessed every sentence in Pubtator Central using spacy's en_core_web_sm model [].
This model breaks every english word down in their root form through a process called lemmatization.
Following this process, we replaced each tagged phrase with it's corresponding entity type that was previously identified.


### BioRxiv

This may need to be described if the preliminary data is promising.

1. Pubtator Central
   1. breif description about the dataset
   2. talk about how it contains entities tagged
2. Word2vec Model
   1. training parameters
   2. Use 10 models for each year
   3. min cutoff is 10
3. Orthogonal Procrustes - to align models onto year 2021
   1. Allows for the models to be directly compared
4. Determining semantic change
	1. Cosine metric to determine difference between words
	2. Scaf ratio method to model temporal changes
	3. CUSUM to actually detect change throughout the years
5. Umap visualization
   1. Explain why aligned umap - preserves local and global structure
   2. mention parameters for aligned umap
