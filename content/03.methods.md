# Methods

1. Pubtator Central
   1. breif description about the dataset
   2. talk about how it contains entities tagged
2. Word2vec Model
   1. training parameters
   2. Use 10 models for each year
   3. min cutoff is 10
3. Orthogonal Procrustes - to align models onto year 2021
   1. Allows for the models to be directly compared
4. Determining semantic change
	1. Cosine metric to determine difference between words
	2. Scaf ratio method to model temporal changes
	3. CUSUM to actually detect change throughout the years
5. Umap visualization
   1. Explain why aligned umap - preserves local and global structure
   2. mention parameters for aligned umap
