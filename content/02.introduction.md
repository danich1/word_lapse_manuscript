# Introduction

Biomedical research is in a constant state of flux.
Researchers are continusouly making new discoveries, writing their discoveries as academic works and publishing their findings within journals and preprint servers.
As a natural consequence these discoveries causes shifts in the context and meaning of words, termed semantic shift.
A notable example of a semantic shift would be the word "pandemic".
This word was centered on influenza and bird flu []; however, there was a subtle shift towards a major focus on the covid-19 pandemic [].
Modeling these types of shifts allow us to ascertain how the landscape of biomedical research is changing.

Diachronic linguistic studies are designed to analyze the literature and detect semantic shifts.
These studies model words based on their context, which consists of a word and its corresponding neighbors.
Often this type of information is captured via a co-occurence matrix [@gulordava-2011-distributional] or through word embeddings [].
Once captured, the next step is to detect a shift in this context

 1. Insert papers for language changes in general

      2. doi:10.1142/9789811232701_0011

      5. arxiv:1606.02821
      6. doi:10.18653/v1/N18-1044 
3. Gap in knowledge: 
	1. work has focused majorly on non-biomedical text
	2. biomedical related work is only on abstract and titles
	3. Work has yet to focus on individual tokens and themes.
	4. The approach for accounting for word2vec instability is novel as previous work haven't undergone that before.
4. Goal is to examine longitudinal trends for biomedical term changes.
