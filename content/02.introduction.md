# Introduction

Language is constantly evolving, and the meaning that we ascribe to words changes over time.
The word "nice" was used to mean foolish or innocent back in the 15th-17th century; then, it underwent a positive shift to its current meaning of "pleasant or delightful"[@doi:10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.013.323].
These shifts occur for many reasons.
For example, writers may use new metaphors or substitute words for others with similar meanings in a process known as metonymy [@doi:10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.013.323].
Studying these shifts can provide a nuanced understanding of how language adapts to describe our world.

Scientific fields of inquiry also change, sometimes rapidly, as researchers devise and test new hypotheses and applications.
For example, the repurposing of the CRISPR-Cas9 system to a pervasive tool for genome editing has altered how we discuss molecular entities.
Microbes use this as an immune system to defend against viruses.
Scientists repurposed this system for genome editing [@doi:10.1126/science.1225829], leading to changes in the use of the term.
Science is a field with substantial written communication [@doi:10.1021/ci00050a001], both via published papers [@doi:10.1073/pnas.98.2.381] and preprints [@doi:10.1101/833400; @doi:10.1126/science.aay2933].
Examining scientific manuscripts with computational linguistics can reveal longitudinal trends in scientific research.

Studying the events in which words change their meanings is called semantic shift detection.
This process involves capturing word usage patterns such as frequency and structure over a set period of time [@arxiv:1806.03537].
Once these patterns have been captured, the last step is utilize these patterns to generate a time series that will show possible shift events, commonly referred to as changepoints [@arxiv:1806.03537].
Scientists have used this approach to discover a vast number of changepoints within publically available english corpora [@doi:10.1145/2736277.2741627; @doi:10.1109/JCDL.2014.6970173; @doi:10.1145/2064448.2064475].
There has been work to identify global patterns, referred to as laws, that semantic shifts can follow. [@arxiv:1605.09096; @xu2015computational].
The first two laws are law of differentiation and law of parallel change, which state that words with similar meanings, e.g. synonyms, tend to change over time and undergo similar changes [@xu2015computational].
The other two laws are law of conformity and law of innovation which states the rate at which words undergo semantic shifts is inversely proportional to its frequency and words that have multiple meanings will have higher rates of change [@arxiv:1605.09096].
There has been work that investigated if any of these laws are upheld within biomedical literature and researchers only found strong enough evidence to support the law of innovation [@doi:10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2017.11.006].
Despite the conflicting evidence for these laws being upheld within biomedical literature, biomedical words and concetps do undergo changes overtime [@doi:10.18653/v1/W19-5037].

The majority of recent work to detect semantic shifts have been outside of biomedical corpora.
Common mediums include newspapers [@doi:10.18653/v1/W17-2705; @arxiv:1711.05603; @doi:10.1017/S0003055417000570], books [@arxiv:1605.09096], reddit [@doi:10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103824], and Twitter [@arxiv:1411.3315].
Researchers have examined topics in information retrieval [@doi:10.1007/s11192-018-2843-2], and in biomedicine COVID-19 has been examined multiple times [@doi:10.1142/9789811232701_0011;@arxiv:2102.07836; @doi:10.2196/22635].
Typically, these time series are generated for individual words by training a unique model on text binned by a selected time period [@arxiv:1605.09096; @arxiv:1606.0282; @doi:10.18653/v1/N18-1044; @doi:10.1017/S1351324918000220].
Methods are then applied to identify "change points" where a word's meaning has changed [@arxiv:0710.3742,@gustafsson].
The amount of open access biomedical literature has dramatically increased in the last two decades, laying the groundwork for the large-scale analysis of semantic shifts in biomedicine.
This work takes a deeper dive onto the word level analyses. 
We take a new approach to account for the word2vec instabilty.

TODO literature search into finding more papers about the semtnatic change
2004.14118 - arxiv, performed a lexical change detection algorithm
1906.02979 - arxiv, performed a large scale experiment to determine which model performs well for semantic change
10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2017.11.006 - Confirmed that some of the words are changing through biomedical literature; however, it may not hold overall 
    Our work takes it a step futher but examining specific changes being detected within biomedical text
10.18653/v1/W19-5037 - seeing concept shifts within biomedical litrature; however, only went up to 2015
10.18653/v1/W19-4728 - This is a paper that was outside of biomedical literature, but might want to cite for this paper

TODO highlight the novel contributions of being the first time this project was done.
1. Provides a listing of potential changepoints for further investigation
2. software contribution - can manually see the differences
</div>
We examine these semantic shifts in this rapidly growing body of open access text.
We include both published papers and preprints in our analysis.
We found that novel strategies integrating multiple models for each year sidestepped the challenge of instability in the machine learning models and allowed us to estimate intra- and inter-year variability.
We identify semantic change points for each token.
We examine key cases and provide the full set of research products, including change points and machine learning models, as openly licensed tools for the community.
We also created a webserver that allows users to analyze tokens of interest on the fly, examining both the most similar terms within a year and temporal trends.
