# Introduction

Biomedical research is constantly evolving as scientists are constantly testing new hypotheses and making new discoveries.
These discoveries result in concepts changing their previously established associations.
A notable example of this type of change would be the concept "pandemic".
It acquired a prevailing association with the COVID-19 virus [@pmid:34545336; @doi:10.1016/j.jiph.2020.03.019].
These types of shifts are important to model as they will allow one to find out how the biomedical concepts are changing.

Studies designed to model semantic shifts use literature as input.
Often these studeis use word embeddings to model these shifts. 
These word embeddings consist of dense vectors that represents a words based on their most similar neighbors [@arxiv:1301.3781].
Often this type of information is captured via a co-occurence matrix [@gulordava-2011-distributional] or through word embeddings [].
Once captured, the next step is to detect a shift in this context

Despite these discoveries large amount of work has been focused on non-biomedical literature.
We aim to model these longitudinal trends.
Our approach will uses multiple models to fix the problem of word2vec variability.

3. Gap in knowledge: 
	1. work has focused majorly on non-biomedical text
	2. biomedical related work is only on abstract and titles
	3. Work has yet to focus on individual tokens and themes.
	4. The approach for accounting for word2vec instability is novel as previous work haven't undergone that before.
