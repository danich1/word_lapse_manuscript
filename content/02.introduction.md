# Introduction

The human language is constantly evolving as words change their meaning over time.
For example, the word "nice" meant "foolish or innocent" back in the 15th-17th century; however, it underwent a positive shift towards meaning "pleasant or delightful" [@doi:10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.013.323].
These shifts occur for many reasons, such as words being used in new metaphors or substituting for other words (metonymy)  [@doi:10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.013.323].
Studying these shifts is essential as they allow one to understand better how human language adapts.

Akin to the human language, science is rapidly evolving as researchers devise new hypotheses and applications.
A notable discovery would be the CRISPR-Cas9 system, which was adapted to become a widely used gene-editing tool [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2015.12.041].
Often, these types of findings are dispensed through written communication [@doi:10.1021/ci00050a001], such as published papers [@doi:10.1073/pnas.98.2.381] and preprints [@doi:10.1101/833400; @doi:10.1126/science.aay2933].
Under this medium, it allows us to see research shifts via a semantic shift detection process.

Detecting semantic shift involves detecting abnormalities in time seqeuences generated via word distributionial models. 
These distrbutional models are formed using techiques such as word2vec [@arxiv:1301.3781] or pointwise mutual information (PMI) [@arxiv:1605.09096].
Once word vectors have been constructed, every word has their own unique coordinate space and an alignment step is needed.
Researchers found that combining frequency with distance similarity improved performance [@doi:10.1007/s00799-019-00271-6].
Researchers used changepoint analysis to identify changes with in biomedical titles [@doi:10.1142/9789811232701_0011].
Researchers found different types of semantic shift categories [@arxiv:1605.09096; arxiv:1606.02821].
Researchers performed a changepoint analysis using twitter data [@arxiv:2102.07836] and political data [@arxiv:1711.05603].
They also used web semantics to generate data [@doi:10.1007/s11192-018-2843-2].
Deep learning to detect changepoints [@doi:10.18653/v1/N18-1044]

Despite these discoveries, there hasn't been work done to analyze biomedical literature on a global scale.
We aim to model these longitudinal trends.
Our approach will uses multiple models to fix the problem of word2vec variability.

3. Gap in knowledge: 
	1. work has focused majorly on non-biomedical text
	2. biomedical related work is only on abstract and titles
	3. Work has yet to focus on individual tokens and themes.
	4. The approach for accounting for word2vec instability is novel as previous work haven't undergone that before.
