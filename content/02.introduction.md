# Introduction

Language is constantly evolving, and the meaning that we ascribe to words changes over time. 
For example, the word "nice" was used to mean foolish or innocent back in the 15th-17th century; then, it underwent a positive shift to its current meaning of "pleasant or delightful"[@doi:10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.013.323]. 
These shifts occur for many reasons.
For example, writers may use new metaphors or substitute words for others with similar meanings in a process known as metonymy [@doi:10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.013.323]. 
Studying these shifts can provide a nuanced understanding of how language adapts to describe our world.

Scientific fields of inquiry also change, sometimes rapidly, as researchers devise and test new hypotheses and applications.
For example, the repurposing of the CRISPR-Cas9 system to a pervasive tool for genome editing has altered how we discuss molecular entities.
Microbes use this as an immune system to defend against viruses.
Scientists repurposed this system for genome editing [@doi:10.1126/science.1225829], leading to changes in the use of the term.
Science is a field with substantial written communication [@doi:10.1021/ci00050a001], both via published papers [@doi:10.1073/pnas.98.2.381] and preprints [@doi:10.1101/833400; @doi:10.1126/science.aay2933].
Examining scientific manuscripts with computational linguistics can reveal longitudinal trends in scientific research.

Studying changes in the use of word meanings is called semantic shift detection.
Approaches for semantic shift detection examine time series datasets that capture word usage patterns, both with respect to frequency and structure.
Typically, these time series are generated for individual words by training a unique model on text binned by a selected time period [@arxiv:1605.09096; @arxiv:1606.0282; @doi:10.18653/v1/N18-1044].
<!--Following time series generation, the next step is to align models to enable comparison [@arxiv:1411.3315].
A common technique for alignment is Orthogonal Procrustes [@doi:10.1007/BF02289451], but other ways to perform alignment have been used [@arxiv:1702.08359; @arxiv:1703.00607].-->
Methods are then applied to identify "changepoints" where a word's meaning has changed [@arxiv:0710.3742,@gustafsson].

Semantic shifts have been examined in many sources. 
Analysis has included newspapers [@doi:10.18653/v1/W17-2705; @arxiv:1711.05603;@doi:10.1017/S0003055417000570], books [@arxiv:1605.09096], reddit [@arxiv:1606.0282], and Twitter [@arxiv:1411.3315].
Researchers have examined topics in information retrieval [@doi:10.1007/s11192-018-2843-2], and in biomedicine COVID-19 has been examined multiple times [@doi:10.1142/9789811232701_0011,@arxiv:2102.07836].
The amount of open access biomedical literature has dramatically increased in the last two decades, laying the groundwork for the large-scale analysis of semantic shifts in biomedicine.

We examine these semantic shifts in this rapidly growing body of open access text.
We include both published papers and preprints in our analysis.
We found that novel strategies integrating multiple models for each year sidestepped the challenge of instability in the machine learning models and allowed us to estimate intra- and inter-year variability.
We identify semantic changepoints for each token.
We examine key cases and provide the full set of research products, including changepoints and machine learning models, as openly licensed tools for the community.
We also created a webserver that allows users to analyze tokens of interest on the fly, examining both the most similar terms within a year and temporal trends.
