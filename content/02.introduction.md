# Introduction

The meaning of words is constantly evolving.
For instance, the word "nice" used to mean foolish or innocent in the 15th-17th centuries, before it underwent a shift to its modern meaning of "pleasant or delightful" [@doi:10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.013.323].
This change can be attributed to writers using new metaphors or substituting words with similar meanings, a process known as metonymy [@doi:10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.013.323].
By studying these shifts, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of how language adapts to describe our world.

Scientific fields of inquiry are constantly evolving as researchers develop and test new hypotheses and applications.
For example, in the interval studied the CRISPR-Cas9 system has been repurposed as a tool for genome editing.
Microbes use this system as a defense against viruses, and scientists have adapted it for genome editing [@doi:10.1126/science.1225829], resulting in changes in the use of the term.
Written communication is an important part of science [@doi:10.1021/ci00050a001], both through published papers [@doi:10.1073/pnas.98.2.381] and preprints [@doi:10.1101/833400; @doi:10.1126/science.aay2933].
By using computational linguistics to analyze scientific manuscripts, we can identify longitudinal trends in scientific research.

The task of detecting changes in the meaning of words is known as semantic shift detection.
This process involves capturing word usage patterns, such as frequency and structure, over a set period of time [@arxiv:1806.03537].
Once captured, the final step is generating a time series to show potential shift events, commonly called changepoints [@arxiv:1806.03537; @arxiv:0710.3742; @gustafsson].
By using this approach, researchers have identified many changepoints within publicly available English corpora [@doi:10.1145/2736277.2741627; @doi:10.1109/JCDL.2014.6970173; @doi:10.1145/2064448.2064475; @doi:10.18653/v1/N18-1044; @doi:10.1017/S1351324918000220].
These discoveries included semantic changes like the meaning of awful shifting from majestic to horrible [@arxiv:1605.09096].
In addition to individual discoveries, scientists have identified global patterns that semantic shifts follow [@arxiv:1605.09096; @xu2015computational].
For instance, words with similar meanings, i.e., synonyms, tend to change over time and undergo similar changes [@xu2015computational].
Other patterns include that words change meaning inversely proportional to their frequency, and words with multiple meanings have higher rates of change [@arxiv:1605.09096].
Most of these discoveries have been made in regular English text.
However, researchers have also attempted to investigate whether these patterns are also found in biomedical literature [@doi:10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2017.11.006].
The only strong evidence they found is that words that change meaning do so inversely proportional to their usage frequency [@doi:10.18653/v1/W19-5037].
Despite conflicting evidence, it is clear that biomedical words and concepts change over time.

Recent studies have investigated semantic shifts in various non-biomedical corpora, such as newspapers [@doi:10.18653/v1/W17-2705; @arxiv:1711.05603; @doi:10.1017/S0003055417000570], books [@arxiv:1605.09096], Reddit [@doi:10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103824], and Twitter [@arxiv:1411.3315].
Other research has focused on semantic shifts in topics related to information retrieval [@doi:10.1007/s11192-018-2843-2], and the COVID-19 pandemic has been studied multiple times [@doi:10.1142/9789811232701_0011;@arxiv:2102.07836; @doi:10.2196/22635].
Additionally, researchers have examined how term usage related to drugs and diseases changes over time [@doi:10.18653/v1/W19-5037].
However, with the dramatic increase in open-access biomedical literature over the last two decades, there is an opportunity to analyze semantic shifts in biomedicine on a whole-literature scale.
This paper takes a deeper dive into this area by exploring semantic shifts in published and preprint works using natural language-processing and machine learning techniques.

We sought to identify semantic shifts in the rapidly growing body of open-access texts, published papers, and preprints.
To do this, we used a novel approach that integrates multiple models to account for the instability of machine learning models trained across various years.
This approach allowed us to identify changepoints for each token and to examine key cases.
We have made our research products, including changepoints and machine learning models, freely available as open licensed tools for the community.
In addition, we have created a web server that allows users to analyze tokens of interest and to observe the most similar terms within a year and temporal trends.
