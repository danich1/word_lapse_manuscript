# Introduction

The human language is constantly evolving as words change their meaning over time.
For example, the word "nice" meant "foolish or innocent" back in the 15th-17th century; however, it underwent a positive shift towards "pleasant or delightful" [@doi:10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.013.323].
There are many reasson for these types of shifts [@doi:10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.013.323] and these shifts are important to study to gain a better understanding on how langugage adapts.

Scentific communication has a crucial role in science as this medium is the sole way researchers disseminate their findings.
Typically, researches are sharing these findings in the form of written communication [@doi:10.1021/ci00050a001].
Akin to language in general this mode of communication causes terms to shift their meaning or association through time.
For example, the word pandemic adpated a new meaning with the term COVID-19. 
These adpatations not only allow for one to understand how human language changes, but can also be applied to research trends as well.

Detecting semantic shift involves detecting abnormalities in time seqeuences generated via word distributionial models. 
These distrbutional models are formed using techiques such as word2vec [@arxiv:1301.3781] or pointwise mutual information (PMI)[].
Once word vectors have been constructed, every word has their own unique coordinate space and an alignment step is needed.
Researchers found that combining frequency with distance similarity improved performance [@doi:10.1007/s00799-019-00271-6].
Researchers used changepoint analysis to identify changes with in biomedical titles [@doi:10.1142/9789811232701_0011].
Researchers found different types of semantic shift categories [@arxiv:1605.09096; arxiv:1606.02821].
Researchers performed a changepoint analysis using twitter data [@arxiv:2102.07836] and political data [@arxiv:1711.05603].
They also used web semantics to generate data [@doi:10.1007/s11192-018-2843-2].
Deep learning to detect changepoints [@doi:10.18653/v1/N18-1044]

Despite these discoveries, there hasn't been work done to analyze biomedical literature on a global scale.
We aim to model these longitudinal trends.
Our approach will uses multiple models to fix the problem of word2vec variability.

3. Gap in knowledge: 
	1. work has focused majorly on non-biomedical text
	2. biomedical related work is only on abstract and titles
	3. Work has yet to focus on individual tokens and themes.
	4. The approach for accounting for word2vec instability is novel as previous work haven't undergone that before.
