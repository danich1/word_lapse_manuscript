# Introduction

Language constantly evolves, and the meaning we ascribe to words changes over time.
The word "nice" was used to mean foolish or innocent back in the 15th-17th century; then, it underwent a positive shift to its current meaning of "pleasant or delightful"[@doi:10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.013.323].
These shifts occur for many reasons.
For example, writers may use new metaphors or substitute words for others with similar meanings in a process known as metonymy [@doi:10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.013.323].
Studying these shifts can provide a nuanced understanding of how language adapts to describe our world.

Scientific fields of inquiry also change, sometimes rapidly, as researchers devise and test new hypotheses and applications.
For example, repurposing the CRISPR-Cas9 system to a pervasive tool for genome editing has altered how we discuss molecular entities.
Microbes use this as an immune system to defend against viruses.
Scientists repurposed this system for genome editing [@doi:10.1126/science.1225829], leading to changes in the use of the term.
Science is a field with substantial written communication [@doi:10.1021/ci00050a001], both via published papers [@doi:10.1073/pnas.98.2.381] and preprints [@doi:10.1101/833400; @doi:10.1126/science.aay2933].
Examining scientific manuscripts with computational linguistics can reveal longitudinal trends in scientific research.

The task of examining if words change their meanings is called semantic shift detection.
This process involves capturing word usage patterns such as frequency and structure over a set period of time [@arxiv:1806.03537].
Once these patterns have been captured, the last step is utilize these patterns to generate a time series that will show possible shift events, commonly referred to as changepoints [@arxiv:1806.03537;@arxiv:0710.3742,@gustafsson].
Scientists have used this approach to discover many changepoints within publically available English corpora [@doi:10.1145/2736277.2741627; @doi:10.1109/JCDL.2014.6970173; @doi:10.1145/2064448.2064475; @doi:10.18653/v1/N18-1044; @doi:10.1017/S1351324918000220].
These discoveries consisted of semantic changes such as awful moving from the meaning of majestic to the meaning of horrible [@arxiv:1605.09096].
Along with individual discoveries, scientists have identified global patterns that semantic shifts can follow [@arxiv:1605.09096; @xu2015computational].
One pattern discovered is that words with similar meanings, i.e., synonyms, tend to change over time and undergo similar changes [@xu2015computational].
The other patterns are that words undergo semantic shifts inversely proportional to their frequency, and words with multiple meanings will have higher rates of change [@arxiv:1605.09096].
The majority of these discoveries have been within regular English text.
There has been an effort to investigate if any of these patterns are upheld within biomedical literature [@doi:10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2017.11.006].
The researchers only found strong evidence of words that change meaning inversely scales to their usage frequency [@doi:10.18653/v1/W19-5037].
Despite the conflicting evidence for these change patterns, biomedical words and concepts change over time.

Most recent work to detect semantic shifts has been outside of biomedical corpora.
Common mediums include newspapers [@doi:10.18653/v1/W17-2705; @arxiv:1711.05603; @doi:10.1017/S0003055417000570], books [@arxiv:1605.09096], reddit [@doi:10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103824], and Twitter [@arxiv:1411.3315].
Researchers have examined topics in information retrieval [@doi:10.1007/s11192-018-2843-2], and in biomedicine COVID-19 has been examined multiple times [@doi:10.1142/9789811232701_0011;@arxiv:2102.07836; @doi:10.2196/22635].
Also, researchers have examined how drugs and disease pairs changed in their usage over time [@doi:10.18653/v1/W19-5037].
Despite these discoveries, the amount of open-access biomedical literature has dramatically increased in the last two decades, laying the groundwork for the large-scale analysis of semantic shifts in biomedicine.
There remains a gap in uncovering semantic change on a global scale within published and preprint works
and this work takes a deeper dive.

To fill this gap, we sought to uncover instances of semantic shifts within the rapidly growing body of open-access texts, published papers, and preprints.
We took a novel approach that integrates multiple models to account for the challenge of instability in the machine learning models trained across various years.
Using this approach, we identified semantic changepoints for each token and examine key changepoint cases.
We provided the full set of research products, including changepoints and machine learning models, as openly licensed tools for the community.
Lastly, we created a web server that allows users to analyze tokens of interest on the fly with respect to the most similar terms within a year and temporal trends.
