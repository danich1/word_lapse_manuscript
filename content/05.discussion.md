# Discussion

Language is rapidly evolving, and the usage of words changes over time, with words assimilating new meanings or associations [@doi:10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.013.323].
Some efforts have been made to study semantic change using biomedical text [@doi:10.1142/9789811232701_0011;@arxiv:2102.07836; @doi:10.2196/22635]; however, no such work has examined the changes evident in both pre-publication peer-reviewed and preprinted biomedical text.

We examined semantic changes within open-access biomedical corpora, Pubmed (PMCOA), and bioRxiv/MedRxiv, for the 2000-2022 interval.
We developed a novel statistic incorporating multiple Word2Vec models to examine semantic changes over two decades.
Before calculating our novel statistic, we used orthogonal processes that align each model (Figure {@fig:word2vec_alignment}).
We found that word vectors are closer together after alignment; however, the best approach to align models still remains open for future investigation [@doi:10.1007/978-3-030-32233-5_58].
As previously reported [@doi:10.1162/tacl_a_00008; @doi:10.48550/arXiv.1804.09692], we did find that without a correction step for the variability within and across years, comparing stable and unstable models is challenging.
Our correction approach showed that the average distances in the earlier years have less variability using multiple models than a single model (Figure {@fig:novel_distance_validation}).

After correcting year variability, our analysis revealed more than 41,000 changepoints, including tokens such as 'cas9', 'pandemic', and 'sars' (Figure {@fig:preprint_published_changepoints}).
Many changepoints overlapping between PMCOA and preprints were related to COVID-19 (Table {@tbl:published_preprint_change_table}), indicating that the COVID-19 pandemic has been strong and immediate enough to induce rapid semantic change across both publishing paradigms [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3000959; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0240123].
We developed a web application that allows users to manually examine individual tokens, making examining other examples within our 41,000 changepoints easier.
However, approaches that can automatically validate these changepoints is an essential area that remains open for future investigation.
