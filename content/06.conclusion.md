# Conclusion

We uncovered semantic changes within biomedical literature using a novel approach that accounts for inter- and intra-year variability.
Our approach found 41,000 changepoints that include well-known examples such as 'cas9', 'pandemic', and 'sars'.
We constructed a web application that allows users to manually examine these individual changepoints.
As an extension to this project, future work may be able to determine the consistency and time-lag of semantic change between preprint and pre-publication peer-reviewed text - potentially predicting future change in pre-publication peer-reviewed text.
Furthermore, including other preprint repositories may reveal consistencies across a broader swath of fields, or within-field analyses may reveal the earliest starting points of semantic changes that ultimately sweep through biomedicine.
Overall, this work is one starting point regarding semantic change within biomedical literature, and we are excited to see how this landscape will change as time progresses.
