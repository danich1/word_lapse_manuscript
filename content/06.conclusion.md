# Conclusion

We uncovered changes in the meanings of words used in biomedical literature using a new approach that took variations between and within years into account.
Our approach identified 41,000 changepoints, including well-known terms such as 'cas9', 'pandemic' and 'sars'.
We created a web application that allows users to investigate these individual changepoints.
As a next step, it would be interesting to see if it is possible to detect the consistency and time-lag of semantic changes between preprints and published peer-reviewed texts.
This discovery could potentially be used to predict future changes within published texts.
Additionally, including other preprint databases may help to uncover consistencies across a wider range of disciplines, or within-field analyses may show the initial stages of semantic changes that will eventually spread throughout biomedicine.
Overall, this research is a starting point for understanding semantic changes in biomedical literature, and we are looking forward to seeing how this area develops over time.
