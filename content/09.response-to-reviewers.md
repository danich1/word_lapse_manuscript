# Response to Reviewers

## Reviewer 1

>In this paper, the authors presented a method to examine the semantic shift in biomedical preprints and pre-publication by machine learning method. This work is very impressive and could have a great impact on the domain. However, the following questions should be addressed before publication.

>Q1: In this work, the author applied word2vec model to train the word embeddings. The main issue is that word2vec has a limited capability to capture contextual information. I would suggest the authors  try other more advanced language model, like BERT to train embeddings.

# TODO add explanation for not using BERT

>Q2: How does the method take care of the new word issue? basically, if there’s a word created in this domain for only a few years and there are very few publications talking about it, then how the performance of this method would be?

# TODO state that this is one limitation for this work 

>Q3: When detecting semantic changes, the cosine distance was used for comparing similarities between words. This method seems too easy and not that robust. Are there any other good ways for detecting?

# TODO detemine if there are alternatives for using cosine similiary to compare word vectors. I don't think there are, but will see

## Reviewer 2

>This paper develops a method to evaluate semantic shifts by calculating annual and interannual changes using multiple integrated models. This method achieves good results, but there are some shortcomings in the paper. There are some suggestions for revision.
>1.      The motivation is not clear. Please specify the importance of this paper.

# TODO mention that we updated the introduction text to make motivation more transparant.

>2.      Please highlight the contributions of this paper.

# TODO mention that we updated the introduction text to make contributions more transparant.

>3.      Most of references are out of date. Please discuss more recently published solutions, especially the solutions published in 2022.

# TODO mention that we updated our litearture review to contain more recent papers on this topic

>4.      In the method part, the authors’ description is not easy to understand. Have the authors considered using drawings to explain the method?

**We have updated our methods section to include a graphical depiction of our data pipeline.**

>5.      When detecting semantic changes across time, the authors mention the use of Cartesian products in calculating interannual changes. What are the advantages of using Cartesian products for the task of this paper?

**The main advantage here is that the cartesian product allows us to directly compute the inter-year distances without the need for a statistical correction.
Since we compute all possible combinations of model pairings, our sample size is sufficiently large enough to obtain inter-year distance estimates.**


>6.      There is something unclear about Figure 1. There are five black dots in the second picture of Figure 1. What is the specific meaning of these five black dots? Please explain it to the author.

**The black dots in Figure 1 are the individual word vectors obtained from their corresponding word2vec model.
We greyed out all tokens except for 'probiotics' to provide an individual example on what occurs without aligning models.**

>7.      Figure 2 has some ambiguities. The authors use single model and multiple model to carry out experiments, and the experimental results are different. Other than using different models, what could be the reason for the difference?

**Insert example on why the scales appear to be different for figure 2**

>8.      For the proposed method, has the author considered applying it to the same type of task and achieving similar results as in this paper? Please explain it to the readers.

**Are they asking have we considered applying this approach to a different setting?**

>9.      More discussions of technical details should be given.

# TODO double check methods and technical details are explained.

## Reviewer 3

>•       The introduction is not clear and very less literature is used. Follow this instruction: The introduction should briefly place the study in a broad context and highlight why it is important. It should define the purpose of the work and its significance, including specific hypotheses being tested. The current state of the research field should be reviewed carefully, and key publications cited. Please highlight controversial and diverging hypotheses when necessary. Finally, briefly mention the main aim of the work and highlight the main conclusions. Keep the introduction comprehensible to scientists working outside the topic of the paper.
>•       In the introduction, what key theoretical perspectives and empirical findings in the main literature have already informed the problem formulation? What major, unaddressed puzzle, controversy, or paradox does this research address?

# TODO we updated the introduction to be more thorough

>•       Authors should further clarify and elaborate novelty in their contribution.

# TODO we updated introduction to include novelty of contribution

>•       What are the limitations of the present work?

# TODO We updated our discussion and conclusion to incorproate this missing section

## Reviewer 4

>This is a well-written manuscript to examine semantic shift in open access biomedical preprints and pre-publication peer-reviewed text. The methods are novel and  are clearly described. The results are clearly presented. It is a pleasure and very easy for audience to follow the paper. It adds to scientific value of the relative research field. I suggest acceptance.

**We appreciate the positive feedback from the reviewer.**
