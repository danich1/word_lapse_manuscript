# Discussion and Conclusion

Discoveries in science are constantly evolving and adapting.
We implemented an analysis to study scientific terms within biomedical literature change their association through time.
We found that aligning Word2Vec models allows for direct comparison; however, there was an issue of variation that needed to be corrected.
We used a novel distance metric as a solution to this problem.
Following the correction, we perform a changepoint detection analysis to discover which terms changed over time.
Out of our detected changepoints 'cas9' and 'pandemic' were iconic positive results as these two tokens were expected to undergo a change. 
Cas9 had been adapted for gene-editing [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2015.12.041], while we recently saw COVID-19 become a surge in recent years [@doi:10.1038/s41591-021-01654-6].
Furthermore, we also noticed that a lot of changepoint that overlapped between published papers and preprints were related to COVID-19.
Many of our called changepoints need further investigation as we only had a manual way to determine their validity.
An open area of work would consist of developing automatic ways to confirm or deny the validity of a changepoint.
Furthermore, the majority of our analyses focused on biomedical works, such as PubMed Central and bioRxiv/medRxiv; however, future work could apply a similar method to other preprint repositories such as arXiv [@doi:10.1108/14666180010345564].
Lastly, we constructed a website that enables a closer examination of individual biomedical terms changing through time.
