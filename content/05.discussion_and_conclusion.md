# Discussion and Conclusion

Biomedical science is constantly evolving.
We implemented an analysis to study how biomedical terms undergo semantic shifts analysis through time.
We found that aligning models allows for direct comparison between word2vec models; however, it cannot correct for inter and intra-year variation.
Our novel distance metric was a solution to fixing this variation problem.
Following the correction, we perform changepoint detection to discover which terms changed over time.
Throughout the published papers dataset, we detected known changes such as CRISPR-Cas9 and pandemic were among our list of changepoints.
Regarding preprints, we noticed that many of our called changepoints were related to COVID-19.
This discovery makes sense as there was a substantial rise in preprints on the discussion of COVID-19 within the past two years [@doi:10.1038/s41591-021-01654-6].
Despite our positive examples, many of our called changepoints remain for further investigation as there isn't an automatic way to confirm or deny their validity.
Future work could incorporate new algorithms or approaches for rapid validation. 
The majority of analyses for this work focused on Pubmed Central, bioRxiv, and medRxv; however, future work could apply a similar method to other preprint repositories such as arXiv [@doi:10.1108/14666180010345564].
Lastly, we constructed a website that enables a rapid examination of a token's trajectory through time.
