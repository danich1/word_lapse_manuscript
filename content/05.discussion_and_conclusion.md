# Discussion and Conclusion

Language is rapidly evolving, and the usage of words changes over time.
These sorts of changes result in words assimilating new meanings or associations.
A modest amount of effort has studied this trend in biomedical text, 
We implemented an analysis to observe how the usage of tokens changes over time using open-access biomedical corpora.

We validated that direct comparison needs a correction step such as Orthogonal Procrustes.
However, even with alignment, systematic differences hidden within these corpora result in variation that needs to be corrected.
We constructed a novel statistic that took the ratio of the average inter-year distance over the sum of the intra-year distances.
This ratio corrected the latent variation without obstructing our ability to detect tokens that were expected to have a change point.

We perform a changepoint detection using the CUSUM algorithm to identify tokens of interest.
We found tokens such as 'cas9', 'pandemic', and 'sars'  to appear in our candidate list.
These tokens were expected to appear as their changes were prominently known within the field [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2015.12.041; @doi:10.1038/s41591-021-01654-6; @doi:10.1046/j.1440-1843.2003.00517.x; @doi:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105924; @doi:10.1038/s41564-020-0695-z].
Furthermore, we noticed many changepoints that overlapped between PMCOA and preprints were related to COVID-19.
Despite our efforts, many of our detected changepoints are subject to further investigation due to the reliance on manual curation for validation.
An open extension to this work would be the development of semi-automatic ways to determine the validity of a changepoint.
In addition to validation, future work could apply a similar approach to other preprint repositories such as arXiv [@doi:10.1108/14666180010345564] or psyArXiv [@doi:10.5260/chara.23.2.38].
Lastly, we created a website that enables a closer examination of individual tokens as they change through time.
