# Discussion and Conclusion

1. We provided a website resource to allow users to see toekn association changes
2. Word2vec is unstable and we implemented an approach to account for that variation
3. Constructs groundwork for future research into token changes
4. Will implement biorxiv and other preprint resources as a next step.
