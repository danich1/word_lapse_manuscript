# Discussion and Conclusion


We implemented a semantic shift analysis to see how biomedical terms change through time.
We found that our novel distance ratio aids in handling the across-year variation.
We notice that a lot of called changepoints are related to COVID-19 as the focus of biomedical research shifted to that concept.
It was also nice to see the confirmation of known changes such as the CRISPR-cas9 system.

This work sets up the potential for future work to detect changepoints.
It'd be interesting to see how this work evolves as time progresses.
Be interesting to see this pipeline be applied to other text such as arxiv or other sources of preprints.
