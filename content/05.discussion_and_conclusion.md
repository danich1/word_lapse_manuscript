# Discussion and Conclusion

Language is rapidly evolving, and the usage of words changes over time [@doi:10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.013.323].
Words assimilate new meanings or associations.
Some efforts have been made to study semantic change using biomedical text [@doi:10.1142/9789811232701_0011;@arxiv:2102.07836; @doi:10.2196/22635]; however, no such work has examined the changes evident in both pre-publication peer reviewed and preprinted biomedical text.
We examined semantic change in both open-access biomedical corpora from Pubmed (PMCOA) and bioRxiv/MedRxiv for the 2000-2021 interval.
Studies like this one have only become feasible recently with the rapid uptake of open access publishing.
To be able to span two decades with very different data availability, we developed a novel statistic that incorporated multiple models using both inter- and intra-year distances.
Without the correction, comparing between stable and unstable models is challenging as previously reported [@doi:10.1162/tacl_a_00008; @doi:10.48550/arXiv.1804.09692].
Our analysis revealed more than 41,000 different change points, including tokens such as 'cas9', 'pandemic', and 'sars'.
Many change points overlapping between PMCOA and preprints were related to COVID-19, indicating that the COVID-19 pandemic has been strong and immediate enough to induce rapid semantic change across both publishing paradigms.

As the amount of preprinted text grows, future work may be able to determine the consistency and time-lag of semantic change between preprint and pre-publication peer-reviewed text - potentially predicting future change in pre-publication peer-reviewed text.
We developed a web application to enable users to investigate individual tokens - automatic approaches that use orthogonal metrics to estimate change point validity would make analysis at scale more straightforward.
Furthermore, including corpora such as the arXiv [@doi:10.1108/14666180010345564] or psyArXiv [@doi:10.5260/chara.23.2.38] repositories may reveal consistencies across a broader swath of fields or within-field analyses may reveal the earliest starting points of semantic changes that ultimately sweep through biomedicine.
