## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Language is constantly evolving, as the meaning we ascribe to words changes over time.
Similarly, scientific fields of inquiry also change as researchers devise and test new hypotheses and applications.
Studying changes in the use of word meanings is called semantic shift detection.
Detecting semantic shifts has been mainly examined outside of the scientific field.
We analyzed these shifts within two open-access biomedical corpora, PubMed Central open access corpus (PMCOA) and bioRxiv/medRxiv.
We used a machine learning-based technique, termed Word2Vec, to represent words based on their corresponding neighbors to model context.
These models cannot be directly compared without a correction step, where we used Orthogonal Procrustes.
This technique enables direct model comparison; however, these models still have variability that needs to be corrected.
We used a novel multi-model approach to account for this issue of variability by constructing a new statistic to account for intra-year and inter-year variability.
Using this statistic, we detected over 40,000 potential change points via PMCOA and over 2260 change points via bioRxiv/medRxiv.
We found tokens expected to have a change point such as 'cas9', 'pandemic', and 'sars' within our listing.
Lastly, we constructed a web application (https://greenelab.github.io/word-lapse/) that allows users to examine any biomedical token on the fly.
