## Abstract {.page_break_before}


Language is constantly evolving, and the meaning that we ascribe to words changes over time.
Scientific fields of inquiry also change, sometimes rapidly, as researchers devise and test new hypotheses and applications.
Studying changes in the use of word meanings is called semantic shift detection. 
Semantic shifts have been mainly examined outside of the scientific field.
We sought to detect semantic shifts within biomedical preprints and published papers.
We used a novel multi-model approach to sidestep the issue of instability within machine learning models, which enabled us to estimate intra-year and inter-year variability.
Using this approach we detected over 40,000 potential changepoints using published papers and over 2200 changepoints using preprints.
Out of our detect changepoints, we found tokens such as 'cas9' and 'pandemic' that provided some validation for this approach.
Lastly, we constructed a web application (https://greenelab.github.io/word-lapse/) that allows users to manually examine any token on the fly.
